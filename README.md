# EasyGUIApi

This is a straightforward Python application that sets up a JSON server with an intuitive interface for configuring response data and authentication methods.

It aims to support novice programmers by offering an easy-to-use tool for simulating APIs, with options for both authenticated and non-authenticated access.

## Features

- Define a custom port for the server.
- Define JSON response data.
- Select between different authentication types: None, Basic Auth, or Bearer JWT.
- Start and stop the server with a button.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x

## Dependencies

PyQt6
Flask
pyjwt

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Usage

Open the application and enter the JSON data you want the server to return.
Optionally, specify a custom port for the server.
Select the desired authentication type (None, Basic Auth, or Bearer JWT).
For Basic Auth, enter the username and password.
For Bearer JWT, a token will be generated by making a POST request to the /login route with the username and password.
Click the 'Enable' button to start the server.
Access the server at http://localhost:[port], where [port] is the port number you specified or the default port 4000.
Click the 'Disable' button to stop the server.

# EasyGUI API

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dozgQAR.png" alt="Logo" width="200" />

This is a straightforward Python application that sets up a JSON server with an intuitive interface for configuring response data and authentication methods.

It aims to support novice programmers by offering an easy-to-use tool for simulating APIs, with options for both authenticated and non-authenticated access.

## Features

- Define a custom port for the server.
- Define or import JSON response data (or use the default one).
- Select between different authentication types: None, Basic Auth, Bearer JWT, OAuth 2, API Key and Digest.
- Start and stop the server with a button.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Dependencies

- PyQt5
- Flask
- pyjwt

## Installation

### Option 1: Using the Executable

1. Download the .exe file from the [Releases](https://github.com/DevDreamy/EasyGUIApi/releases) page.
2. Run the .exe file and start your server.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DevDreamy/EasyGUIApi.git
    cd repository
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Enter the JSON data you want the server to return.
3. Optionally, specify a custom port for the server.
4. Select the desired authentication type:
    - None
        - No authentication required.
    - Basic Auth:
        - Enter the username and password.
    - Bearer JWT:
        - A token will be generated by making a POST request to the /token route with the username and password.
    - OAuth 2:
        - Token is generated by making a POST request to the /token route with client_id, client_secret, and grant_type.
    - API Key:
       - Include the API key in the X-API-KEY header in your request.
    - Digest:
       - The server will prompt for digest authentication credentials if they are missing or invalid.
        - Ensure you provide the correct username, realm, password, and nonce for successful authentication.
5. Click the 'Enable' button to start the server.
6. Access the server at http://localhost:[port], where [port] is the port number you specified or the default port 4000.
